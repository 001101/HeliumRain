 - Fast-paced combat with a Newtonian flight model
 - Localized damage model for spacecrafts

## About this repository

We provide these sources for reference - *you won't be able to run the game from this project*, as the game contents are not included. The main reason for this is our usage of third-party contents, including Unreal Marketplace assets. The size of the full project is also prohibitive for platforms like GitHub. We hope this can be a learning resource for people trying to use Unreal Engine for large projects.

This project is brought to you by Deimos Games.
